    "# Diabetes Prediction on CDC Dataset — Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Build a machine learning pipeline to predict diabetes status using a CDC health survey dataset (e.g., BRFSS / CDC diabetes data). The goal is a reproducible notebook that performs data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation, and basic explainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Load and understand the CDC diabetes dataset.\n",
    "- Clean and preprocess features (missing values, categorical encoding, scaling).\n",
    "- Train baseline and advanced classifiers to predict diabetes.\n",
    "- Evaluate models with appropriate metrics and cross-validation.\n",
    "- Provide model interpretation and deployment-ready artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data (high level)\n",
    "- Source: CDC public survey data (BRFSS or similar) containing demographics, lifestyle, clinical indicators and a diabetes label.\n",
    "- Typical columns: age, sex, BMI, physical activity, smoking, blood pressure, cholesterol, survey responses, and a binary diabetes indicator.\n",
    "- Expected issues: missing data, class imbalance, mixed data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline / Tasks\n",
    "1. Data ingestion and schema inspection\n",
    "2. Data cleaning and imputation\n",
    "3. Exploratory Data Analysis (distributions, correlations, class balance)\n",
    "4. Feature engineering and encoding\n",
    "5. Train/test split and cross-validation\n",
    "6. Baseline model (Logistic Regression) and stronger models (Random Forest, XGBoost)\n",
    "7. Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearch / Randomized CV)\n",
    "8. Evaluation: ROC AUC, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix, calibration\n",
    "9. Model interpretation (feature importance, SHAP)\n",
    "10. Save best model and provide sample inference code\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation criteria\n",
    "- Robustness (cross-validated performance)\n",
    "- Balanced metrics for imbalanced classes (AUC, recall for positive class)\n",
    "- Interpretability and reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "- Jupyter notebook with EDA, modeling, and interpretation\n",
    "- Trained model artifact and inference snippet\n",
    "- Short README summarizing findings and next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next steps\n",
    "- Obtain/confirm exact CDC dataset and target definition.\n",
    "- Implement preprocessing and baseline model.\n",
    "- Iterate with feature selection and tuning based on validation results."
